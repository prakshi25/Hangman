# Hangman
Hangman is a guessing game for single player playing opposite computer. There are a bunch of different words stored in the computer. The computer picks a random word out of those words and the player tries to guess it by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses. The word to guess is represented by a row of dashes, representing each letter of the word. If the player suggests a letter which occurs in the word, the other computet writes it in all its correct positions. If the suggested letter does not occur in the word, the other player draws one element of a hanged man stick figure as a tally mark. The player guessing the word may, at any time, attempt to guess the whole word. If the word is correct, the game is over and the guesser wins. Otherwise, the other player may choose to penalize the guesser by adding an element to the diagram. On the other hand, if the other player makes enough incorrect guesses to allow his opponent to complete the diagram, the game is also over, this time with the guesser losing. However, the guesser can also win by guessing all the letters that appear in the word, thereby completing the word, before the diagram is completed.
